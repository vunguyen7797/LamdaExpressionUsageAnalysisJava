# Project Name
Lambda expression in Java

# Team Members:
 * Duc Anh Vu Nguyen: I did the analyzing part to find out Lambda expression usage over time in Java projects.
 * Cory Huffine: Evaluated data to create visual graphs for each open-source project.

# About
This is a Software Engineering class project that analyzes the usage of Lambda Expression in Java projects in order to answer two questions?
 * Why do language designers implement Lambda expressions into their languages?
 * Is it possible to implement Lambda expressions on complex methods/function?
 
Four open-source projects we chose to analyze were:
 * PMD, a cross-language static code analyzer
 * Hanabi-Java, a card game in Java used for research
 * Apache Flink, a framework and processing engine for computations over data streams
 * Guava, a collection of core Google libraries
 
## Instruction
Since different tools and data were utilized to complete this project, this repository is not a complete package to run.
All the detail of the project is described in the presentation file and research paper file which can be found in this repository.

## Tools
 * Java, Python, MySql, Octave
